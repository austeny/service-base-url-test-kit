    These tests verify that the server makes Service Base URL list publicly available in the Bundle format with valid Endpoint and Organization entries.

    A Certified API developer must publish, at no charge, the service base URLs and related organizational details that can be used by patients to access their electronic health information
    These service base URLs and organizational details must conform to the following:
      - Service based URLs must be publicly published in Endpoint resource format according to the standard adopted in ยง 170.215\(a\) - 
        FHIR 4.0.1 release 
      - Organization details for each service base URL must be publicly published in Organization resource format according to the implementation 
        specifications adopted in the US Core: ยง 170.215\(b\)\(1\)\)
      - Each Organization resource must contain:
        - A reference in the Organization.endpoint element, to the Endpoint resources containing service base URLs managed by this organization
        - The organization's name, location, and provider identifier 
      - Endpoint and Organization resources must be:
        - Collected into a Bundle resource formatted according to the standard adopted in FHIR v4.0.1: ยง 170.215\(a\) for publication
        - Reviewed quarterly and, as necessary, updated
